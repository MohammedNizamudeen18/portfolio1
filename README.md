# Ernest-Network-and-Security-Portfolio
I am developing a network engineering and cyber security portfolio on Linux and Windows os, network tools, and cloud tools.

## Professional Statements
This section is the statement about the professional I would like to develop.

My name is Phurit Pookayaporn (Ernest). I graduated from Chulalongkorn University (Bangkok, Thailand) with a Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering. I worked at a space company based in Thailand for two years as an engineer and led the development and manufacturing of satellite components, systems, and projects; including sending space payloads to sub-orbital and Low-earth orbit. The work, although mostly outsourced and partnered, I have learned project management, systems engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer engineering. Bits by bits, I am inspired to pursue an IT career, specifically in network engineering and cyber security from a motivation of digital economy and Low-earth orbit internet satellite constellations.
