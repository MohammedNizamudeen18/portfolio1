The organization (approach) to learn in a course composes of the following principles:
1. The structure and outline of the curriculum may be extracted from online degree courses (i.e., Coursera at this time),
2. A set of credible academic references shall be the baseline information since their contents are stable,
3. In each course, the readines, listenings, and watching shall be summarized,
4. In each course, a set of quizzes and assignments shall be documented to demonstrate the learning.
